# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

  This project provides a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data of human belly buttons. The data was collected from volunteers, and the dashboard allows users to select the individual's ID and display charts that represent the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) and the weekly washing frequency value.

 ### Technologies Used
 * JavaScript
* Plotly
* D3.js
### Deliverable 1: Horizontal Bar Chart (35 points)
This deliverable provides a horizontal bar chart that represents the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual's ID is selected from the dropdown menu. The chart displays the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

### Deliverable 2: Bubble Chart (30 points)
This deliverable provides a bubble chart that represents the bacterial data of a selected individual's OTUs. The chart displays the otu_ids as the x-axis values, the sample_values as the y-axis values, the sample_values as the marker size, the otu_ids as the marker colors, and the otu_labels as the hover-text values.

### Deliverable 3: Gauge Chart (20 points)
This deliverable provides a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency value. The chart is updated when an individual's ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
